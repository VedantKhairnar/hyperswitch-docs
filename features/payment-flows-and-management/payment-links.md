* Add a payment processor to you account

#### Using Payment links

#### 1. Update [business profile ](https://api-reference.hyperswitch.io/api-reference/business-profile/business-profile--update)with a default payment\_link\_config by passing the below object in the request body

{% code fullWidth="true" %}
```
‚Äúpayment_link_config‚Äù : {
   ‚Äútheme‚Äù: Option<String> // Custom theme color for your payment link, Can be any html color hex code Eg. #143F1E
   ‚Äúlogo‚Äù: Option<String> // Custom logo for your company; Can be any hosted image url Eg. ‚Äúhttps://i.pinimg.com/736x/4d/83/5c/4d835ca8aafbbb15f84d07d926fda473.jpg‚Äù,
   ‚Äúseller_name‚Äù: Option<String> // Name of your company;Eg: Shoekraft 
   ‚Äúsdk_layout‚Äù: Option<String> // Custom sdk layout for your payment links: 'accordion', 'spaced_accordion', 'tabs'; 'tabs' is default
   ‚Äúdomain_name‚Äù: Option<String> // custom domain name of the merchant; Eg: pay.shoekraft.com     
}
```
{% endcode %}

#### 2. [Create a payment link ](https://api-reference.hyperswitch.io/api-reference/payments/payments--create)by using the same payments/create endpoint

\- Set "payment\_link" = "true" to create a payment link with default payment\_link\_configs configs set in business profile update mentioned in Step 1

\- You can also pass the  "session\_expiry" field in seconds to indicate the expiry of the payment link. By default it is 900 seconds (15 minutes)

```
curl --location 'https://sandbox.hyperswitch.io/payments' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
--data '{
    "amount": 1130,
    "currency": "USD",
    "confirm": false,
    "customer_id": "cus_123",
    "return_url": "https://hyperswitch.io",
    "description": "For selling Tshirt",
    "payment_link": true,
    "session_expiry": 2592000
}'
```

#### 3. Customizing a Payment link during creation:

You can also customize a specific payment link by including the payment\_link\_config object while creating a link during [payments/create](https://api-reference.hyperswitch.io/api-reference/payments/payments--create) call as well. Except for domain\_name field from the same object in business\_profile/update, you could customize the remaining fields.

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

### FAQ

<details>

<summary>Can I create a payment link pointing to my custom domain?</summary>

Yes. Your custom domain can be included in the default payment\_link\_config object as part of the business profile update.&#x20;

This involves adding CNAME records and TLS certificates which ends up being a slightly complex process. Please reach out to our [Support](https://join.slack.com/t/hyperswitch-io/shared\_invite/zt-1k6cz4lee-SAJzhz6bjmpp4jZCDOtOIg) to test this feature out with your custom domain.
