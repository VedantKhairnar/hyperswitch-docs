{% hint style="info" %}
This section covers detailed understanding of how to use and configure Hyperswitch Recon to streamline your financial processes
{% endhint %}

Hyperswitch Recon module allows reconciliation between the transaction data from Hyperswitch,  the settlement data shared by payment gateways and the merchant account statement from the bank. This process is designed to ensure financial accuracy and streamlines settlement processes. The system ensures that businesses receive reconciliation results promptly, fostering informed decision-making.

## Why should you use Hyperswitch reconciliation?

As organisations grow and the transaction volumes increase, payments start flowing in and out of single or multiple payment partners. Manual or excel based reconciliation becomes highly complex and time-consuming. Manual processes make it challenging to handle the varied fee structures and taxes across multiple currencies. Status lags and operational problems lead to risks of duplicity, mismatches, and transactional fraud.

Hyperswitch Recon gives you complete control of your reconciliation process, making it faster, efficient, and scalable. It lets you automate your data collection across different partners with zero development effort, thus giving you instant access to summarised results of open items, state of receivables, and any settlement discrepancies.&#x20;

### **Set up the Recon module**

**Step 3:** Configure the file formats of Hyperswitch, PSPs, and bank reports by communicating with the recon team via email. It usually take 1-2 days for the team to configure the module as per your requirements. To configure PSP or bank report file formats, you need to have sample data in the right format. Numerous PSPs support various API reports tailored for different use cases. You must select the report that aligns with your specific business requirements. Moreover, we provide support for multiple file formats for a single PSP.

**Step 4:** Once reconciliation is active for your merchant account, you will be notified through email, and you are good to go for payment reconciliation.

### **Try the Recon module**

**Step 5:** Once your account is configured, log into Hyperswitch dashboard and click on 'Go to recon tab' then you will be redirected to the recon dashboard.&#x20;
